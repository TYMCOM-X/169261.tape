The TIME.SHEETS procedure has been fixed up a little.  You may now
specify a list of resources to generate/load time sheets for.  There
is also a new command OUTSTANDING to list all time sheets that have
ben GEN'd but not LOAD'd.

The procedure BUG may now be used to report bugs.  It is available
as the BUG command in mostly everything that takes commands.
/WRS 24-SEP-81

Signifigant improvement to UPDATER - more on the way.
/WRS 13-SEP-81

Wrote quick hack MAILING.LIST program to generate .CMD files for RPG:
    USRS.CMD - all MTS resources
    MGRS.CMD - all MTS managers 
/WRS 11-SEP-81

Changed MTX to accept the RES.ID argument.
/WRS 10-SEP-81

Rewrote the report RESOURCE.STATUS.  Old report is now called 
PC70.Resource.Status.  The new report shows less detail: 1 line
per project.  Projects are grouped by status.  The command now
takes an optional argument which is the resource to report for.
This argument defaults to the resource running the report.  All
resources reporting to the selected resource are shown along with
the one selected.

Fixed bug in TIME.SHEETS causing today to be used as the DOE for TASKS
following new projects.
/WRS 9-SEP-81

Fixed bug in TIME.SHEETS causing HISTORY multiple records to show up as
duplicates of the first one.
/WRS 31-AUG-81

Added the field ACT.SUS to relation NODE to hold the actual suspense
date for projects which are suspended.  The proper way to derive
project status is now (order is important):
    if ACT.END # default 	then % completed %
    else if ACT.SUS # default	then % suspended %
    else if KIND = 2 	 	then % ongoing %
    else if ACT.BEG # default 	then % inprogress %
    else if EST.BEG # default	then % pending %
    else 			     % unscheduled %
/WRS 31-AUG-81

Corrected bug in TIME.SHEETS preventing certain projects from
appearing.  
/WRS 30-AUG-81

Enhancements to NODE.TREE report - it is now readable.
/WRS 30-AUG-81

Added code to TIME.SHEETS to insert nodes if the ID field is null.
Nodes will be inserted under node whose ID is in RES.NEW(RES).  If
RES.NEW(RES) is null, that resource will not be allowed to insert
new nodes.
/WRS 27-AUG-81

Seperated internal procedures to manipulate NODE structure into texts:
	NEW.NODE
	INSERT.NODE
	DELETE.NODE
and changed the affected procedures to use them.  This should correct
problems causing structure inconsistencies.
/WRS 23-AUG-81

New command in MTX:
	NEWS
will display the contents of the file (TYMXMTS)NEWS.TXT (this one).
/WRS 23-AUG-81
	
New procedure:
	RUN CHECKER
will report any structure inconsistencies in the NODE relation.  Do not
try to fix the problems unless you are a bonafide MTS wizard.
